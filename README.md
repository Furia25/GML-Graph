# Graph Library for GameMaker

A comprehensive graph data structure implementation for the latest versions of GameMaker Studio 2. This project aims to provide the most complete set of graph theory features and algorithms possible, while serving as a practical exploration of graph theory concepts.

## Features

This library offers a wide range of graph operations including:
- Multiple graph types (directed, weighted, immutable)
- Classic graph algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra, pathfinding)
- Graph manipulation and analysis tools

The goal is to continuously expand functionality to cover as much of graph theory as practical for game development.

## Installation

Download the latest `.yymps` package from the [Releases](../../releases) page and import it into your GameMaker project.

## Quick Start

Create a graph with specific flags, add nodes and edges, then run algorithms to analyze the structure. 
The library supports method chaining for clean, readable code.

## Performance

While this library strives for efficiency, it will never be perfect. Any contributions, optimizations, or suggestions to improve performance are greatly appreciated!
